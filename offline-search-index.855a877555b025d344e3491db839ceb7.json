You can see an example of a smaller Docsy documentation site in the Docsy User Guide, which lives in the Docsy theme repo if you’d like to copy its docs section.\nOther content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the About and Community pages.\nFind out how to use the Docsy theme in the Docsy User Guide. You can learn more about how to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in Organizing Your Content.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template …","ref":"/piv-agent/docs/","tags":"","title":"Documentation"},{"body":" Welcome to Goldydocs: A Docsy Example Project!
